# Galaxian-Space-Defender
game prototype
To check out the game click on CLONE OR DOWNLOAD in the Github page to download the project as a ZIP file.  Download the ZIP file to your
computer, unzip the files and then run GalaxianSpaceDefender.exe.

Keep in mind this game is NOWHERE near finished.  It's basically just a demo of the cool U.I. elememts...  as well as the animation, sound effects and basic gameplay.

I'm always adding features to it though - so if you haven't seen it in awhile...  Check it out !
